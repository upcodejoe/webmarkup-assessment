        <h2>
            Global story about AI Referree
        </h2>
        <p>
            Almost every football fan heard that in the future we may replace human referees with AI referrees completely. 
            Most of them are happy about it because there are a lot of mistakes been done by human referrees that resulted massive disappointments.
            Just imagine if it is 90th minute of the world cup final game, and the score is even. The opponent team's defender kicks your player in the 18 yard box, normally it would result in a penalty right?
            But the human referee was far away and he didn't see clearly, therefore he decided to continue the game. Now you lost a potential world cup.

        <h2>
            What problem does AI Referree innovation solve?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Human can be biast or make mistakes when it comes to being a referree in a match. Human can act by their emotions, and that leads to mistakes.
            AI referee solves those problems. Because computers or softwares doesn't have any emotion. They just execute pre-determined instructions, even if the instructions written by another computer.
            So there is no room for random mistakes, or decisions made by emotions. Therefore you get stability and justice for sports matches.

        <h2>
            How to use the AI referre?
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to have an AI referre working properly, you need to have a lot of cameras and sensors for data input.
            You also need to establish a secure network for those cameras, computers and sensors, so you don't get hacked by a sports club fan and get very biast decisions.
            Then you need a powerful computer that runs the AI referree software. That software takes all the data input from the field, stores them meaningfully, and makes calculations and decisions based on that data.

        <h2>
            Who is using the AI referree?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Some of the sports organizations started to use AI referee and other AI sport technologies to support human referrees.
            So we still have human referees in the game, but most of the time when players react to decisions, human referee goes to the corner and checks what the AI referree decided.
            And if needed, he changes his decision in order to provide more fair decisions.

        <h2>
            What can you expect from the AI referree service ?
        </h2>
        <p>
            We can definitely expect that the sport matches will be more fair with the help of AI referrees. 
            With more and more companies invests in this market, we can see the gamespeed goes up. 
            Because normally players would argue with the decision of the human referree and it would take a lot of time.
            With the AI referree that is not in the case because all the decisions would be fast and reliable.

        <h2>
            Future from AI referee
        </h2>
        <p>
            I think in the future we can see more and more sport matches without a human referee. 
            There may be a big screen that prints the output of AI referree. So players can see the decisions and continue to the game.
            There would be also less disappointments among fans because they would be sure that the decisions are not biast.
